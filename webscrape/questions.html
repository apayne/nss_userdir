        <h3>Some Questions and Answers about Userdir</h3>

        <p>
        <b>Q:</b>
        This won't scale. Won't it be way too slow as the number of users
        (and thus directory entries) increase?</p>

        <p>
        <b>A:</b>
        I realize a lot of filesystems are deficient when it comes to
        directories with a large number of entries.
        Fortunately, FreeBSD has UFS with DIRHASH and Linux has Reiserfs
        which don't suffer from these shortcomings. As for performance,
        this scheme still probably isn't going to beat a Berkeley DB file
        (or CDB file) or possibly even reading sequentially from a flat
        <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> file, but the way I see it is, the increase
        in flexibility more than makes up for the (possibly negligible)
        performance loss.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Q:</b>
        How about a directory hashing scheme so it's not all under one big
        directory?</p>

        <p>
        <b>A:</b>
        A hashing scheme (i.e. <tt>/etc/users/d/r/drench/</tt>) would break
        the very clean and simple API of disk I/O on files under
        <tt>/etc/users/<i>USERNAME</i>/</tt>, unless we can all agree on
        a consistent "depth" (highly unlikely). As I said above, if
        performance on large directories is an issue, that's a filesystem
        problem, and it's one that's been largely solved.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Q:</b>
        Why not make SHELL a symlink to the shell itself or DIR a symlink
        to the user's home directory?

        <p>
        <b>A:</b>
        While it would be nice to be able to <tt>cd /etc/users/drench/DIR</tt>
        to get to my home directory or execute
        <tt>/etc/users/drench/SHELL</tt> directly, I think it's even more
        important that shell scripts be able to do things like
        <tt>HOME=`cat /etc/users/drench/DIR`</tt>. It also then ceases to
        be an <tt>envdir</tt> (i.e. I don't want the contents of the variable
        SHELL to be the binary contents of the executable). I also like
        consistency: you can change <b>any</b> field with
        <tt>echo 'value' &gt; FIELDNAME</tt> in the current scheme.
        I don't want to go down the path where some need to be symlinks,
        and some need to be plain files. Plus, this is Unix. If you want
        to execute your shell, type <tt>`cat /etc/users/mylogin/SHELL`</tt>.

        <p>
        <b>Q:</b>
        Wouldn't it be more appropriate to use "HOME" for the user's
        home directory instead of "DIR"?</p>

        <p>
        <b>A:</b>
        I considered using different names for the files,
        but I decided that being a drop-in replacement, it would be
        appropriate to not deviate from the names as they are defined
        in <tt>struct passwd</tt>. So the filenames are identical to
        the structure, except that I uppercased them. You're
        always free to symlink HOME to DIR if you like.</p>

        <p>
        <b>Q:</b>
        Why <tt>/etc/users</tt>? Why not register a name under
        <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120223134710/http://cr.yp.to/slashpackage.html">slashpackage</a>?</p>

        <p>
        <b>A:</b>
        At first I thought about putting it under <tt>/config/users</tt>
        or <tt>/users</tt>, but I settled on <tt>/etc/users</tt> because
        the fact is there are many reactionaries in the Unix community
        who would dismiss the concept out of hand if I had done that.
        Witness the hostility toward the work of
        <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120223134710/http://cr.yp.to/djb.html">D.J. Bernstein</a>.
        Still, I'm sure a lot of people are going to dismiss <b>userdir</b>
        out of hand just because it's still too radically different from
        <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>. As for
            <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120223134710/http://cr.yp.to/slashpackage.html">slashpackage</a>,
        I'll consider it, but ultimately I want to see <b>userdir</b> as an
        integral part of every Unix system, not an optional package.
        If I'm misunderstanding the concept of
        <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120223134710/http://cr.yp.to/slashpackage.html">slashpackage</a>, please
        correct me.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Q:</b>
        Why not just use <tt>/home</tt>? It's already there and already
        includes user metadata in the form of dotfiles and the like.</b></p>

        <p>
        <b>A:</b>
        That's an interesting idea. I need to ponder that, since I do have a
        few concerns about it. For one, most system administrators let users
        own their own home directories, and there are certain fields
        (UID in particular) that only the system administrator should be
        able to modify (simple root exploit that would work under the current
        implementation under /home: <tt>rm ~/UID &amp;&amp;
        echo 0 &gt; ~/UID</tt>). There are ways to lock this down, certainly,
        but I'd like to make the transition as painless as possible.
        This would also break <tt>envdir</tt> unless we created another
        subdirectory that contains the Userdir fields, like
        <tt>~/.userdir/</tt>. There's also potential confusion: I have a lot
        of users whose home directories are not under /home. So for example,
        <tt>/home/pgsql/DIR</tt> might contain <tt>/usr/local/pgsql</tt>.
        Not really a big deal, and it's something fairly easy to work around
        with symlinks.  If you like, you can try it under /home
        right now: <tt>ln -s /home /etc/users</tt>.
