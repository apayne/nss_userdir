        <h3>Userdir: the end of <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>?</h3>
        <p><b>Userdir</b> is so far not much more than a proof-of-concept
        drop-in replacement for FreeBSD's <tt>getpwent.c</tt>, but I believe
        it has the potential to displace <tt>/etc/password</tt> (and its
        friends like <tt>/etc/master.passwd</tt> and <tt>vipw</tt>).</p>

        <p>The idea behind it is simple: rather than have one flat
           root-owned file containing the entire user database, <b>userdir</b>
           takes advantage of the powerful hierarchical database that is
           the Unix filesystem. Each login name has its own directory, and
           each field in <tt>struct passwd</tt> is represented inside that
           directory by an appropriately named text file.  For example, user
           "bob"'s shell is in <tt>/etc/users/bob/SHELL</tt> and his home
           directory is in <tt>/etc/users/bob/DIR</tt>.  And you can find
           his UID in <tt>/etc/users/bob/UID</tt>.  His crypted password is
           in <tt>/etc/users/bob/PASSWD</tt>, and since by default this file
           is mode 0400 and owned by root, there's no need for a separate
           "shadow" password file.  Of course the system administrator is
           free to give "bob" (or bob's boss) read and/or write access to
           this file, paving the way for a (still vaporware) <tt>passwd</tt>
           utility that doesn't <a href="pwsetuid.html">need</a> its
           setuid bit set.
        </p>

        <p>And that's just one of <a href="possibilities.html">many things</a>
           that are easy to do with <b>userdir</b> that are either difficult
           or not possible at all with a traditional <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>
           system.
        </p>

        <h3>How you can help</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>If you have a FreeBSD 4.x system that you're willing to
                experiment with, <a href="install.html">install</a> the code
                and help me improve it.  It's under a BSD-type license.
                Or if you like, rewrite it completely since it's really not
                very complicated and you're probably a better C programmer
                than I am.</p>
            </li>

            <li><p>Try writing an NSS module, if you are running a system
                   that supports such things, that implements userdir.
                   M.J. Pomraning is working on a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120223133916/http://pilcrow.madison.wi.us/sw/nss_userdir-20020430.tgz">Linux implementation</a>.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><p>If you are running NetBSD, OpenBSD, or FreeBSD-CURRENT,
                try implementing userdir under that version of NSS.</p>
            </li>

            <li><p>Some important commands need to become "userdir-aware"
                like <tt>passwd</tt> and <tt>adduser</tt> (and <tt>useradd</tt>
                on Linux).</p>
            </li>

            <li><p>Consider ways of replacing other flat systems files like
                <tt>/etc/group</tt> with a directory hierarchy.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
