        <h3>Installing Userdir</h3>
        <p><b>WARNING:</b> This is highly experimental code that alters libc.
        It is possible that installing this code will cause <tt>login</tt>
        to break and render your machine unusable. Take proper backups,
        have rescue floppies at hand, and don't install it on a machine that
        has any kind of important function of any kind.</p>

        <p>I have only run this code on FreeBSD 4.x series systems and
           these instructions apply specifically to FreeBSD 4.x. It may
           very well work as-is on other BSD systems, but I don't guarantee
           anything.  I won't even guarantee that this code won't do nasty
           things to your FreeBSD 4.x machine, because it just might.
           <b>USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!</b></p>

        <p>One last warning: The NIS/YP client code in FreeBSD 4.x is tied
           into the standard getpwent.c and I did <b>not</b> reimplement it.
           In other words, understand that if you use this getpwent.c
           replacement, you will not be able to use NIS/YP as a client.
           I suppose it could still work as an NIS server, but you read the
           previous two paragraphs and wouldn't think of doing that.</p>

        <p>Still with me?</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Fetch and, as root, run <a href="pw2userdir.pl">pw2userdir.pl</a>, a Perl script
                that converts your current <tt>/etc/passwd</tt> into an
                <tt>/etc/users</tt> hierarchy. I encourage you to do some
                sanity checks to see that the contents of <tt>/etc/users</tt>
                corresponds to your existing password file before continuing.
                </p>
            </li>
                
            <li><p>Fetch <a href="getpwent.c">getpwent.c</a>, the userdir
                replacement for the standard FreeBSD source file.
                Copy this file to <tt>/usr/src/lib/libc/gen/getpwent.c</tt>
                (assuming you have full sources installed under
                <tt>/usr/src</tt>).
                Make a backup copy of the original <tt>getpwent.c</tt>
                if you like before overwriting it.</p>
            </li>

            <li><p><tt>cd /usr/src &amp;&amp; make buildworld</tt> to rebuild
                your system with userdir.</p>
            </li> 

            <li><p>You may wish to try out the new libc before installing it.
                Set <tt>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/obj/usr/src/lib/libc</tt> and try
                some commands that use the getpw* functions like <tt>id</tt>
                and <tt>finger</tt>. Note that some commands like <tt>ls</tt>
                and <tt>ps</tt> are statically linked in FreeBSD, and will not
                be using the new userdir-enabled libc at this point unless
                you try something like <tt>/usr/obj/usr/src/bin/ls/ls</tt>.</p>
            </li>

            <li><p><tt>cd /usr/src &amp;&amp; make
               installworld</tt>, reboot your system, and then let
