nss_userdir README
30 Apr 2002

Overview
--------
An implementation of Dan Rench's nascent userdir proposal as an NSS service
under Linux/glibc.  See http://home.xnet.com/~drench/userdir/ for more
information.

nss_userdir is free software, with no warranties of any kind.


Specifics
---------
Installed as an NSS module (servicename:  userdir), getpw* commands will
consult the directory ``/etc/users/$USERNAME'' for account information.

  struct passwd		userdir file
  -------------		------------
  pw_name		NAME
  pw_passwd		PASSWD
  pw_uid		UID
  pw_gid		GID
  pw_gecos		GECOS
  pw_dir		DIR
  pw_shell		SHELL


Files may presently _not_ be absent (though they may be empty).
Non-directories under /etc/users are ignored.


TODO
----
testing
spwent/grent support (userdir spec permitting)
packaging
